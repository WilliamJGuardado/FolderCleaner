# File Organizer

## Project Description
The File Organizer is a Python script designed to automatically sort and move files from a download directory into appropriate subdirectories based on file type. This script supports various file types including images, videos, audio files, documents, ZIP archives, and CSV files. It also handles naming conflicts by making filenames unique if a duplicate is detected.

## Features
- **Auto-sorting**: Automatically moves files to designated folders based on their extensions.
- **Support for Multiple File Types**: Handles images, videos, audio, documents, ZIPs, and CSVs.
- **Logging**: Logs all file movements and errors for easy troubleshooting.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Renames files if a file with the same name already exists in the destination directory.
